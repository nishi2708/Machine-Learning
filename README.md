# Machine-Learning
Included Naive Bayes classifier and Logistic Regression Classifier in one python file only.
To run this code type the command : "python classifiers.py"
Functionality:
 It will display the accuracy for each fraction of training dataset for both classifiers.
 It will also display the learning curve for both the classifiers in same figure. So that we can compare accuracies for both
 classifiers for given dataset.
